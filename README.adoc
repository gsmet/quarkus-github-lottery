= Quarkus GitHub Lottery

> A Quarkus-powered GitHub App that regularly sends short lists of GitHub issues for triagers/maintainers to consider.

[[intro]]
== Introduction

This GitHub App is based on the https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-github-app[Quarkus GitHub App framework].

It periodically extracts GitHub issues from one GitHub repository (e.g. https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus)
and notifies maintainers about them by commenting on GitHub issues in another GitHub repository
(e.g. https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-github-lottery-reports).
That second "reports" repository may be private,
as it's only about notifying maintainers.

Each maintainer who participates in the lottery (opt-in)
gets their own dedicated GitHub issue in the "reports" repository,
on which the application will add one comment mentioning the maintainer
each time its sends a notification.
That way, maintainers will get daily (or weekly) reports via email,
sent by GitHub when the comment is added.

Issues are randomly assigned among eligible maintainers up to a limit they define themselves,
so that everyone gets a chance to help according to the time they want to invest.

There are multiple categories of issues that one can be notified about;
see <<maintainers>> for more information, but here's what an email notification may look like:

== Triagers/Maintainers: how to get notifications

[[participants-basics]]
=== Basics

As a Quarkus triager or a Quarkus core/extension maintainer,
in order to get notifications about Quarkus issues on GitHub:

* Make sure you have access to the https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-github-lottery-reports["reports" repository]
  if not, request access to an admin of the https://github.com/quarkusio[quarkusio] organization.
* Send a pull request to the "watched" repository (most likely https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus)
  to edit file https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/.github/quarkus-github-lottery.yml[`.github/quarkus-github-lottery.yml`].
  Add an entry with your username to the `participations` section.

Here is what an entry will look like:

[source,yaml]
----
# [...]
participations:
  - username: "yrodiere"
    timezone: "Europe/Paris"
    triage:
      days: ["MONDAY", "WEDNESDAY", "FRIDAY"]
      maxIssues: 3
    maintenance:
      labels: ["area/hibernate-orm", "area/hibernate-search"]
      days: ["TUESDAY"]
      reproducer:
        needed:
          maxIssues: 4
        provided:
          maxIssues: 2
      stale:
        maxIssues: 5
----

`username`::
Your GitHub username.
+
String, mandatory, no default.
`timezone`::
Your timezone, to get notifications at the right time on the right day.
+
`java.time.ZoneId` as a String, optional, defaults to `UTC`.
`triage`::
Optional section for triagers.
+
See <<participants-triage>> for details.
`maintenance`::
Optional section for maintainers.
+
See <<participants-maintenance>> for details.

The `triage` and `maintenance` sections are both optional;
you may participate in triage but not maintain an area of Quarkus, and vice-versa,
or do both.
See below for details about each section.

[[participants-triage]]
=== Triage

If the `triage` section is present, you will get notified when new issues are created
and need to be routed to the right person/team.

Addressing these notifications generally involves removing the `triage/needs-triage` label,
adding the correct `+area/*+` labels, and optionally pinging the relevant maintainers
(though the https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-github-bot#triage-issues[Quarkus GitHub Bot should generally take care of that part]
once you add `+area/*+` labels).

Of course, some more discussion might be necessary before that, and that's fine:
issues that don't change will reappear in another notification, a few days later.

The `triage` section will look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
# [...]
participations:
  - username: "yrodiere"
    triage:
      days: ["MONDAY", "TUESDAY", "WEDNESDAY", "THURSDAY", "FRIDAY"]
      maxIssues: 3
----

`days`::
On which days you wish to get notified about triage.
+
Array of ``WeekDay``s, mandatory, no default.
`maxIssues`::
How many issues, at most, you wish to be included in the "triage" category
for each notification.
+
Integer, mandatory, no default.

[[participants-maintenance]]
=== Maintenance

If the `maintenance` section is present, you will get notified about issues
related to a specific area (e.g. `area/hibernate-orm`)
that may be stalled and require intervention from maintainers or reporters.

Issues in "maintenance" notifications will be split in three categories:

Reproducer Needed::
These issues have the `needs-reproducer` label,
and it looks like the Quarkus team was the last to comment on the issue,
quite some time ago.
+
Depending on the actual content of the issue, you might want to:
+
* send a (gentle!) reminder to the reporter that we need a reproducer before we can do anything.
* or, if it's really been too long, close the issue because we cannot reproduce it.
Reproducer Provided::
These issues have the `needs-reproducer` label,
and it looks like someone who is not from the Quarkus team was the last to comment on the issue,
quite some time ago.
+
There might be a reproducer there, in which case you might want to remove the `needs-reproducer` label
and have a closer look.
Stale::
These issues have not been updated for a very long time.
+
Depending on the actual content of the issue, you might want to:
+
* prioritize the issue and work on it soon;
* or send a reminder to someone you've been waiting on;
* or close the issue because it's no longer relevant.

Of course, in every situation, simply continuing the conversation,
pinging someone, or even doing nothing at all are perfectly acceptable responses:
it's all up to you, and issues that don't change will reappear in another notification, a few days later.

The `maintenance` section will look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
# [...]
participations:
  - username: "yrodiere"
    maintenance:
      labels: ["area/hibernate-orm", "area/hibernate-search", "area/elasticsearch"]
      days: ["MONDAY", "TUESDAY", "WEDNESDAY", "THURSDAY", "FRIDAY"]
      reproducer:
        needed:
          maxIssues: 4
        provided:
          maxIssues: 2
      stale:
        maxIssues: 5
----

`labels`::
The labels identifying issues you are interested in, as a maintainer.
Issues mentioned in notifications will have at least one of those labels.
+
Array of Strings, mandatory, no default.
`days`::
On which days you wish to get notified about maintenance.
+
Array of ``WeekDay``s, mandatory, no default.
`reproducer.needed.maxIssues`::
How many issues, at most, you wish to be included in the "Reproducer needed" category
for each notification.
+
Integer, mandatory, no default.
`reproducer.provided.maxIssues`::
How many issues, at most, you wish to be included in the "Reproducer provided" category
for each notification.
+
Integer, mandatory, no default.
`stale.maxIssues`::
How many issues, at most, you wish to be included in the "Stale" category
for each notification.
+
Integer, mandatory, no default.

[[config-validation]]
=== Validation of the configuration

The application will automatically add a check to any pull request that changes its <<config,configuration file>>.

The check is fairly simple, it just attempts to deserialize the YAML file and reports any exception.

[[commands]]
=== Comment-based commands

https://quarkiverse.github.io/quarkiverse-docs/quarkus-github-app/dev/commands.html[Comment-based commands]
are available for admins.
You can invoke it by adding a comment on any issue or pull request for repositories where the app is installed.

It supports the following commands:

* `/lottery draw`: force a lottery draw immediately.
<<delay-and-timeout,Timeouts>> are still complied with,
so this command is mostly useful if you manually edited the notification history or changed the configuration,
which may happen frequently in dev mode in particular.

[[contributing]]
== Contributing

To participate in the development of this GitHub App, create a playground project in your own org and
follow the steps outlined in https://quarkiverse.github.io/quarkiverse-docs/quarkus-github-app/dev/index.html[the Quarkus GitHub App documentation].

When registering your app, request the following Repository permissions:

* Checks - `Read & Write`: to <<config-validation,validate configuration files>>.
* Issues - `Read & Write`: to list issues that should be notified, and create "notification" issues in another repository.
* Pull Requests - `Read & Write`: to react to <<commands,comment-based commands>>.

And subscribe to the following events:

* Check run, Check suite, Pull request: to <<config-validation,validate configuration files>>.
* Issue comment: to listen to <<commands,comment-based commands>>.

[[deployment]]
== Deployment

Deployment should happen automatically when pushing to the `main` branch.

Maintainers can review the application and update configuration/secrets
at https://console-openshift-console.apps.ospo-osci.z3b1.p1.openshiftapps.com/

Be careful about which configuration you change in the UI,
as deployment may overwrite part of the topology.
